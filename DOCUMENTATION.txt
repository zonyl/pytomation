7) Creating an Instance
    



1) DOWNLOADING PYTOMATION

Right now Pytomation is only available from the git repository.
You must make sure you have git installed on your system.

Debian based distributions such as Debian, Mint and Ubuntu can install
git with the package manager or via command line with the following 
command:

    sudo apt-get install git
    
Once git is installed you can clone the repository with this command:

    git clone git://github.com/zonyl/pytomation.git
    

    
2) INSTALLATION

Before you can create an instance and run Pytomation automation 
software you must satisfy a few dependencies.  Pytomation is written in
Python and currently has been tested under versions 2.6.x and 2.7.x.

Pytomation also requires the following packages to be installed:

Pyserial - Support for RS232 serial interfaces.
Pyephem  - High-precision astronomy computations for sunrise/sunset.
Pytz     - World timezone definitions.
Mock     - Python testing library.

Debian packages are available for Pyserial and can be installed with

    sudo apt-get install python-serial
    
or search for python serial in your software manager.

The other pieces can be installed with "pip". "Pip" is a tool for 
installing and managing Python packages, such as those found in the 
Python Package Index.

Again, under Debian distributions you can install the python-pip
package:

    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    
Once pip is installed it is easy to install the rest of the dependencies
with the following commands.

    sudo pip install pytz pyephem mock
    
You are now ready to configure pytomation and create an instance to run
your devices.  

Pytomation supports declared objects that provide certain functionality,
with each object supporting a set of states.  It is this support that 
provides Pytomation intelligence about these objects and allows it to
manipulate them.



3) INTERFACES

As mentioned above, Pytomation supports a range of device drivers or 
“Interfaces”, that allow Pytomation to talk and listen to the real 
world.  There are more being developed all the time and by the time.

Insteon
-------
Insteon is a power line control product that transmits and receives 
data across the 120VAC house wiring. Insteon supports a wide range of 
devices from wall switches and lamp modules to relay contacts and 
thermostats.  Pytomation uses a computer interface called a 
Power Line Modem (PLM) that connects via USB, RS232 or Network to your 
computer.  Below are the model numbers supported.

2413S – RS232 PowerLinc Modem
2413U – USB PowerLinc Modem
2412N – TCP/IP PowerLinc Modem

The PLM communicates to wall switches and lamp modules etc.  Here is a 
small list of devices known to work.  This is by no means all of the 
devices that will work.  We will provide an updated complete list as 
time allows.

SwitchLinc 600watt Dimmer wall switch  -  2476D
SwitchLinc Relay wall switch, 17amp    -  2477S
LampLinc 300watt Dimmer plugin module  -  2457D2
Appliance plugin module 15amp          -  2456S3 


UPB
---
Universal Powerline Bus (UPB) is a highly reliable, cost effective, 
2-way communications technology similar to Insteon but supports a much 
higher voltage on the power line which can provide more reliable 
communications.  

Similar to Insteon, Pytomation communicates to switch, lamp and other  
modules via a computer interface called a PIM, Powerline Interface 
Module. It is a small plug-in device designed to be the interface 
between an RS232 or USB port on a computer or dedicated controller and 
the powerline.  At this point in time UPB probably has much the best 
support in Pytomation vs Insteon.

UPB has the following advantages over say Insteon:
  - Its incredibly simple and based loosely on X10 protocol
  - It sends at 8V which can power through most noise
  - 2 way devices by default
  - PCS is completely open about their protocol.  No SDK fee, no NDA.
  - The protocol in the last 10 years has never changed
  - Light switches can actually decouple the load from the switch.  
    The switch can control something that isn't the attached load and 
    vice / versa
  - All UPB devices can relay UPB messages.  No one has implemented 
    this yet, but I intend to as I have a problematic switch on the 
    other side of the house.
  - Have never had a UPB device die on a surge suppressed house.  Cant 
    say the same about insteon
  - PCS has given me equipment before.
  - The UPSTART configuration program (free from PCS) can do anything 
    without ever having to physically touch the equipment to configure.

Disadvantges:
- Expensive
- No RF

Below are the model numbers supported.

PIM-R – RS232 PowerLine Interface Module
PIM-U – USB PowerLine Interface Module

The PIM communicates to wall switches and lamp modules etc.  Here is a 
small list of devices known to work.  This is by no means all of the 
devices that will work. We will provide an updated complete list as 
time allows.

Wall Switch Dimmer           - WS1D 
Wall Switch LED and CFL's    - WS1DL
Lamp Module                  - LM1
Appliance Module             - AM1



WTDIO digital I/O
-----------------
Weeder Technologies I/O board provides serial RS232 to 14 I/O lines all 
individually controlled as in or out. All inputs incorporate a pull-up 
resistor to 5-volts, simplifying hookup to switch contacts.Weeder boards are DIP switch addressable so you can stack up to 32modules on the same port for 448 I/O points.

These boards are great for interfacing to door contacts and standard 
motion detectors.

Pytomation currently supports the following model:

14 Channel RS232 digital I/O board  -  WTDIO



WGL & Associates W800RF32 
-------------------------
The W800 family of RF receivers are designed to receive X10 RF signals 
generated from X10 products such as key chain remotes, Hawkeye motion 
detectors, Slimeline wall switches and many, many other X10 RF devices.

The W800 then sends these commands directly to your computer's RS232 or 
USB port, depending on the model purchased. This allows your computer 
to receive X10 RF commands from remotes and motion detectors directly, 
without having to broadcast any power line commands.

Pytomation currently supports the following model:

X10 RF receiver with the RS232 interface  - W800RF32A
X10 RF receiver with the USB interface    - W800USB

Note International models differ.



4) ATTRIBUTES

Most devices can be used with an attribute that modifies the behaviour 
of the device.  Some attributes belong to a specfic device.  Here is a 
list and description of each device

Common States Available -> on | off | motion | still | light | dark

delay
    Delay is used to add a time delay to a device operation.  For 
    example if you wanted turn a light off 2 minutes after it turned on,
    you would use a "delay_off" attribute.  All time is valued in 
    seconds but can be a math equation, so 300 seconds or 5*60 seconds.
    
    Syntax:
        delay_<state>=<time in seconds>  
        
    Example:
        delay_off=300  or delay_off=5*60
    
ignore
    Ignore is used to override a state change that would be set by 
    another device such as "Location".  For example if you have a Light
    that is tied to a "Location" device, the light would normally turn 
    on at sunset and off at sunrise.  Most people will want to override
    this with a "time_off" attribute so the light doesn't stay on all
    night long.  The "time_off" would have to be accompanied by an 
    "ignore_dark" attribute to override the "Location" keeping the light
    on during dark hours.
    
    Syntax:
	    ignore_<state>=True|False      
    
    Example:
        ignore_dark=True  or ignore_dark=False
        
    
name
    Name is used to give your device a human readable name when used
    in the logging of operations.
    
    Example:
        name="Family room sofa lamp"
        
sync
    Enables the device to frequently re-send its state to the attached
    physical device in an effort to keep the state in sync.  When enabled
    this will send a command to the interface every 30-60 minutes randomly
    
    Syntax:
    sync=<True|False>
    
    Example:
    	sync=True # Enable device syncing

time
    Time is used to change the state of a device from whatever is stated.
    Again we use the light example.  If you wanted a light to turn on 
    at 6:00pm and off at 10:45pm, you would use "time" to do it.
    All time is valued in hours and minutes and either AM or PM.
    
    Syntax:
    time_<state>=<'HH:MMpm|am'>
    
    Example:
        time_on='6:00pm'
        time_off='10:45pm'



5) DEVICES

The following devices are currently defined but are by no means the 
limit, new devices will be created as design dictates.

Each device has at a minimum an "address" and a "devices" attribute.  

"address" is the hardware address associated with the device.  A few 
examples are:

Insteon   - "12.C0.D5"
UPB       - (48,2)
W800rf32  - 'A1'
Wtdio     - 'AE' 

Note: the UPB devices have a dual part address and must be enclosed in 
parentheses.

"devices" can be many but at a minimum, it must include the interface
the address is associated with.  This device is dependent on how you 
declared the interface. 


Door
    States supported - UNKNOWN, OPENED, CLOSED
    
    A Door device is used when a door has a contact which realizes the
    current state of the door as being open or closed.
    
    Example:
    
    front_door = Door(address='AA', devices=wtdio)

              
Generic

    An Interface Device is used for generic devices that don't conform 
    to objects such as lights, doors and motion.
    
    For example, a keychain remote such as a Slimfire KR19A or a 
    Slimline SS13A wall switch that talks to a W800RF32 Interface and 
    has 'ON' and 'OFF" buttons would be defined as a Generic 
    device.  It could then be used to turn devices such as lights, on 
    and off.
    
    Examples:
    
    # Button on a Slimline wall switch
    living_room_sofa = Generic('A1', w800)

    # Tie it to a Light device
    sofa_light = Light(address='12.E4.88',
                       devices=(insteon, living_room_sofa)
                      )
    

Light
    States supported - UNKNOWN, ON, OFF
    
    A Light device has the following attributes associated with it:
    
    delay_off
    time_on
    time_off
    ignore_dark

    
    Examples:
    
    # Lets define three lights connected to different interfaces.
    
    #Insteon light
    hall_light = Light(address='12.E4.88',
                       devices=insteon
                      )
    # UPB light    
    hall_light = Light(address=(48,4),
                       devices=upb
                      )
    # An LED connected to a WTDIO board
    led_light = Light(address='A4',
                      devices=wtdio
                     )
    
    *** Note ***  The "insteon", "upb" and "wtdio" values are actually
    variables that you define in your code.  They could be called
    "Ins", "U48" and "WIO" if you want.
    
    
    Using the attributes.
    
    To turn the light on at 5:00pm and off at 10:30pm
    
    hall_light = Light(address='12.E4.88',
                       devices=insteon,
                       time_on='5:00pm',
                       time_off='10:30pm
                      )
    
    To turn the light off 2 minutes after it comes on
    
    hall_light = Light(address='12.E4.88',
                       devices=insteon,
                       time_on='5:00pm',
                       delay_off=120      
                      )
    
    or you can use math, "delay_off=2*60"
    

Location

    The location device is essentially a virtual Photocell that will 
    turn dark / light automatically based on the system clock and the 
    specified location.   
    
    It supports Standard = Sunset / Sunrise, CIVIL, and ASTRONOMICAL 
    modes as well.
	
	Attributes:
	latitude
	longitude
	tz == Time Zone for your location
	is_dst == Do you observe daylight savings time

    Examples:

    # Monitoring twilight
    # Define a virtual photocell based on longitude and latitude and
    # whether daylight savings time used at that location.
    ph_civil = Location('35.2269', '-80.8433', 
                         tz='US/Eastern', 
                         mode=Location.MODE.CIVIL, 
                         is_dst=True)

    ph_standard = Location('35.2269', '-80.8433', 
                            tz='US/Eastern', 
                            mode=Location.MODE.STANDARD, 
                            is_dst=True)

    # In a nut shell CIVIL is brighter than STANDARD which is brighter
    # than ASTRONIMICAL.
    

Motion
    States supported - UNKNOWN, MOTION, STILL
    
    A Motion device has the following attributes associated with it:
    
    delay_still
    
    Examples:
    
    # Lets define two motion detectors connected to different interfaces.
    
    # X10 MS16A Wireless motion detector via a W800RF32 interface
    hall_motion = Motion(address='E1',
                         devices=w800
                        )
              
    # A standard wired motion detector connected to a WTDIO board
    stairs_motion = Motion(address='A4',
                           devices=wtdio
                          )
    
    *** Note ***  The "insteon", "upb" and "wtdio" values are actually
    variables that you define in your code.  They could be called
    "Ins", "U48" and "WIO" if you want.
    
    
    Using the attributes.
    
    # Define a motion device but give it a bit of debounce because it 
    # is hardwired and will go on and off rapidly.
    hall_motion = Motion(address='A4',
                         devices=wtdio,
                         delay_still=60
                        )
    

Photocell
    States supported - UNKNOWN, DARK, LIGHT

    A Photocell device is used when one wants to monitor the region of
    light and dark in a room or outside.
    
    Example:
    
    front_door_cell = Photocell(address='A2', devices=w800)

    

   
6) CONFIGURING   ***** UNDER CONSTRUCTION *****
    ** The configuration file is being migrated to a different format **
    
    Pytomation has a main configuration file.  It is divided into
    sections.  The first section is strictly system configuration, it
    should not generally be changed unless you are doing driver or 
    system code.
    
    The second section is where one can set general user options.

    The configuration file is found in pytomation/common/config.py
    The configuration file is found in pytomation/config/config.py
    

    # ********************* SYSYTEM CONFIGURATION ONLY ********************

    # debug{} holds the global debug dictionary. A complete description is 
    # available in Pytomation documentation.  Briefly it holds a string key
    # and an integer value.  Example: ['Serial':1, 'UPB':0]  These values
    # are set and registered with each module in the class __init__().
    # 
    # Only system values are initialized here.
    debug = {'HAInterface':0, 'Serial':0}


    # ********************* USER CONFIGURATION ****************************

    # LOGGING
    # Setup logging of Pytomation to a log file.  Pytomation will rotate
    # the log file out to pylog_date_time.log every time it starts, if  
    # "logfilePreserve" and "logging" is set to "True".  If you want to 
    # turn log file logging off, just set "logging" to "False"
    # Logfiles can be rotated on a weekly or monthly basis by setting
    # "logfileRotate to 'week' or 'month'
    # If logfileTimestamp is set to a format that can be used by the Python
    # time.strftime() function like the example below that will be printed at
    # the beginning of each debug line.  Otherwise it should be an empty
    # string "".
    # logfileTimestamp = "[%Y/%M/%D-%H:%M:%S]"

    logfile = os.path.join(sys.path[0], 'pylog.log')
    logfilePreserve = True
    logfileTimestamp = "[%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S] "
    #logfileTimestamp = ""
    logfileRotate = 'week'
    logging = False



7) CREATING AN INSTANCE

    Okay, lets go through creating an instance that you can use to model 
    your own control situation.
    
    First it is easiest to run your instance from a shell script.  The 
    script will set up any environment variables that you might require
    as well as anything you might want to do before you run Pytomation.
    
    Here is a script, common convention is to name it the same as your
    instance.py file.  So myhouse.sh and myhouse.py, for example.
    
    You should store these files in the pytomation/instances directory 
    and run them from there unless you change the bash script.
    
    #!/bin/bash
    export PYTHONPATH=../
    python ./myhouse.py

    
    The next step is to create your instance python file, myhouse.py
    
    First we need to import a few modules.
     
    # import the standard python module "select"
    import select
    
    # Import all the Pytomation interfaces we are going to use.
    from pytomation.interfaces import UPB, InsteonPLM, TCP, Serial, Wtdio, W800rf32
    
    # Import all the Pytomation Devices we will use.
    from pytomation.devices import Motion, Door, Light, Location, Generic, Photocell


    ###################### INTERFACE CONFIG #########################
    
    This is where we define the interfaces that we want to use with our 
    instance.  Below we are using UPB, Insteon, W800rf32 and Wtdio.
    
    # Our interfaces are all connected via serial ports.  Two ports are 
    # standard, which under Linux are ttyS0 and ttyS1 and two are USB to 
    # serial converters, ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB1
    
    upb = UPB(Serial('/dev/ttyS0', 4800))
    insteon = InsteonPLM(Serial('/dev/ttyS1', 19200))
    w800 = W800rf32(Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 4800)) 
    wtdio = Wtdio(Serial('/dev/ttyUSB1', 9600))

    # The Weeder board has to be told which point is an INPUT or OUTPUT
    
    # You must set the I/O channels on the WTDIO board according to the 
    # command set  S = Switch, L = Output, default low
    #
    # Inputs are set according to the wtdio manual by sending the board 
    # data in the following sequence.  BOARD TYPE CHANNEL
    # Example:  Board 'A', Type SWITCH, Channel D  - 'ASD'
    # Currently only SWITCH inputs are handled.
    #
    # Outputs are set as follows: BOARD LEVEL CHANNEL
    # Example:  Board 'A', Level LOW, Channel 'M', - 'ALM'
    #
    # Set channels A, B and C as input and channel H as output
    wtdio.setChannel('ASA')
    wtdio.setChannel('ASB')
    wtdio.setChannel('ASC')
    wtdio.setChannel('ALH')

    ###################### DEVICE CONFIG #########################

    Now that we have our interfaces configured we can start to define
    the devices we are going to control or receive input from.
    
    Syntax for configuring a device is:
    
    # Simple form
    var = Device(address, interface)
    
    # more complex
    var = Device(address=address,
                 devices=(interface, comma separated list of device vars),
                 attribute1,
                 attribute2
                )
    # NOTE: every device must have and 'address' and an 'interface'

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    # DOORS   -  Input device
    #
    # We have two doors in the house that have hardwired door switches 
    # and are connected to a Weeder Technologies WTDIO board.
    
    # Using the "wtdio" interface we defined above, we can define the
    # door switches.  The doors are connected to the Weeder WTDIO
    # Board with a board address configured as 'A', the front_door is 
    # wired to point 'A' and the garage_door is wired to point 'B'.

    
    
    front_door = Door('AA', wtdio)
    garage_door = Door('AB', wtdio)

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    # Generic   -  Input device
    #
    # Next we have an X10 KR22A keychain remote that transmits data to 
    # the W800rf32 interface.  This is a generic interface device so we
    # define it as an "Generic".  The X10 address of the KR22A
    # has been previously set to 'E', it has two sets of 'On/Off' 
    # buttons which are E1 and E2.

    kr22a_remote_1 = Generic('E1', w800)
    kr22a_remote_2 = Generic('E2', w800)

    # We also have an X10 Slimline SS13A wall switch but use only the top 
    # button set.
    
    sofa_switch =  = Generic('A1', w800)
    
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    # MOTION   -  Input device
    #
    # Now we move on to defining Motion devices.  Here we have two 
    # motion detectors, one is a wireless RF X10 MS16A and the other is
    # hardwired to point 'C' of the WTDIO board.
    #
    # The wtdio motion detector has a debounce "delay_still" setting on it
    # so it won't trigger again for 10 seconds.
